However, the spindly beauty of this recent Oregon transplant's guitar work outshines any morose adjectives that you can throw at it. Understated, yet fascinating and intricate guitar lines are backed by a hushed coo and are at various times augmented with a lush harmonium drone, percussion, and effects that seem to stretch each note out to the spirit world.<br /> <br /> This is Ilyas Ahmed's fourth release, and the first to be put out on a label other than his own. Of course, Nemo over at Time-lag HQ knows a good thing when he hears it: ""Century of Moonlight"" is a six-song masterpiece.<br /> <br /> Tracks such as ""Softly, Tomorrow,"" ""Red Spring,"" and ""The Gathering"" serve to draw the listener deep into inner space, while the excellent ""Your One Mind,"" and ""Seen Through"" call forth the spirits of the great steel guitar gods of yore. ""Kabhi ma Boley Ashista"" is a beautiful droning raga that will leave the hair on your neck standing straight up.<br /> <br /> Packaged in a gorgeous burnt-orange tri-folded sleeve, ""Century of Moonlight"" is a magical excursion through the mysterious night. With Ilyas Ahmed as our guide through this strange penumbra, we have nothing to fear. 9/10 (-review by <a href=""http://www.digitalisindustries.com/foxyd/writers.php?which=493"" target=""_blank"">Byron Hayes</a> at <a href=""http://www.digitalisindustries.com/foxyd/reviews.php?which=1707"" target=""_blank"">Digitalis Industries</a>)</p>",2341,en,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 International,1966,,1,,[],Softly Tomorrow

<p>Back in the late 80's I walked into the Ritz in the middle of the Laughing Hyenas and watched in disbelief while singer John Brannon churned out one hell of a gutteral yowl for the duration of a whole set in almost inhuman fashion. The Hyenas channelled extreme rage through total Stooge/primal Alice Cooper mode with a somewhat bluesy Birthday Party swagger, and eventually I learned he fronted Detroit's hardcore godfathers <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/negativeapproach"">Negative Approach</a> in the early part of that decade. Later it all came into focus: NA were very much first-wave and represented Detroit as one of the pockets dotted around the USA (see Black Flag, Minor Threat, Bad Brains), with Brannon &amp; company consolidating the midwest brotherhood with the Necros and Meatmen and eventually moving into early singles via Corey Rusk's Touch and Go label (originally a zine, where yes, people learned of the underground way before the internet). As far as first-wave HC goes, Negative Approach were among the most vicious feedback-pummel units going. Songs careened by in seconds, were pretty much politics-free, focusing on sheer vocal/instrumental destruction. They were inspired by not only their American peers, but UK groundbreakers like Discharge (who, like, NA, were big Stooges fans). In 2006 they returned to the stage at the Touch and Go label anniversary, with Brannon and original drummer Chris Moore augmented by Ron Sakowski on bass and Harold Richardson on guitar, reportedly wiped the place down. On the day of their recent Southpaw show, they amazingly agreed in a day's notice to come down to <a href=""http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/BT"">my show on FMU</a>, plugged in and turned us to mush with 16 songs in 25 minutes.</p>

<p><a href=""http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=24229658"">Harvey Milk</a> are without a doubt one band I am obsessed with, and the funny thing is that most people I meet who are fans of them are also obsessed with them; it seems that there are few casual listeners to their music. Born in Athens, GA in the early 1990's, they issued a slew of records that should have been recognized much more than they were; their non-peggability probably hurt their public/press profile, not to mention the neo-Barrett psychedelia that was emerging from their hometown overshadowing them somewhat in the scheme of collegiate radio. But what amazing records, and thanks to people like <a href=""http://www.chunklet.com/"">Chunklet</a>, <a href=""http://www.relapse.com/""> Relapse</a>, <a href=""http://www.tumult.net/"">tUMULT</a> and others, the microscope once again has turned to them in the last few years and they've come back into action fully. I finally saw them for the first time a few years ago at Tonic opening for Khanate, and it remains one of my favorite live show memories. They sucked the oxygen out of the air for minutes at a time; extended passages of silence give way to crushing, Melvinsy swaths of pure majestic overload; singer/guitarist Creston issued forth gutteral vocals like he was fronting Lynard Skynard slowed down to 16 RPM. Muzzy chords would just loom ominously over the room for what seemed like an eternity and then they'd crack open into propulsive Thin Lizzy mode and change bizarre time signatures on a dime and sounded just fantastic. When asked if they could get on <a href=""http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2008/03/whos-who-at-the.html"">WFMU's SXSW bill</a> for March, I couldn't have been more thrilled. We had a close call getting HM on my show a few years back but some crossed signals confused their show-up time with their club soundcheck; my engineer had by then gone home and I was devastated. But now, having the band show up and kick off the proceedings at Spiro's first on the bill (sorry about the club's drink ticketkeeper being AWOL, Stephen!) was a total freakin' dream come true. With Joe Preston (Melvins/Thrones) on 2nd guitar! What a way to start an evening.</p>",4128,en,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 International,2570,,6,,[],I've Got a Love

As everyone who knows me knows, I just can't resist a good waltz, and  that one's a real snooker. What scant arabic I know all comes  from staring at old records, and this is not an especially  efficient method for learning foreign languages.

It was recorded at the home of Laurie Carlos in St, Paul, MN. I was staying there up on her loft floor.


 Marlies Yearby's Movin Spirits Dance Company was in residence at the Guthrie Theater workshoping “Feathers.” The loft became my studio. The recording was done with a 4 track Tascam cassette tape deck with a
Shure SM58 microphone.
I later gave the recorder to Isaiah Parker.

It is modeled after a bamboo that I then owned made in India. The Indian flutes have very thin walls and create the sound that is most appealing to me.
I acquired a length of thin bamboo and made this one.

The little melody was inspired by Baka (Pygmy) music I was listening to in preparation for writing music for a National Geographic Television documentary about the Lowland Gorillas of the Congo.

This melody is an example of something simple that is complete and needs no additions, no harmonization, or orchestration.",16058,,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives (aka Music Sharing) 3.0 International,13265,,1,,[],(a) The Forest

                                        <p>I have had the fortune of
exchanging musical notions with James; we've spoken of stretching one's
ear and being open to anything being called music. </p>

<p>'Wick' is the fourth track on James' 2008 album Fresh Twigs. (I have
copy #10 out of 250). The track was initially called ""Stern Fifths"" on a
 pre-master disc James gave to me. This is a personal and intimate
rendering with careful attention to detail played on an old Gibson 330. </p>

<p>""Wick"" begins as a curiosity, like waking up [0:00-0:08]. But a dark
foreboding feeling enters the picture [0:09- 0:20] prompting further
investigation which develops into an exploratory amble. We take a detour
 into a momentary middle eastern flourish [0:40-0:49] then return to an
amber mood [0:50-1:00], sliding up to a jazzy riff [1:01-1:13], followed
 by a classical figure [1:14-1:37]. The run at the end of the piece
reminds me of a progressive rock riff [1:38-1:46].  There are nice runs
between blocks of chords. At times medieval, at times jazzy and
definitely a uniquely ""James' presence. The rhythm of this piece is
tricky; between the arpeggiated moments and the chord-to-chord moments,
the runs in between chords, sliding moments and harmonics -- it's got it
 all! </p>

<p>The last harmonics, our payoff, are like a little joke but still not
entirely devoid of something lurking beneath the surface. It's been said
 there's a grain of truth in every joke. I think James understands this
in music.  The amble, the stroll in this tune comes out of a dark woods
and returns there, but by the end of the track we feel better for it and
 for the climb. The last progression towards triumph; we'll be okay!
(Two harmonics at the very end say, or will we?)</p>

<p>James has provided us with a feast. There is a lot of information in
""Wick"" containing both form and function in a mere two minutes. I
warbled and tried to play along to ""Wick"" as a means to orient myself
but ultimately it's not necessary and since I'm not trained in music not
 fruitful. What we have is a condensed travel-log -- apprehensive at
times and dark other times but joyous in the journey always.<br /><em>--Philip Lynch</em></p></div></div>",9424,,Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States,7159,,4,,"['guitar', 'experimental', 'electro-acoustic', 'instrumental', 'solo guitar', 'art rock', 'free improvisation']",Wick
